# OKE-Connect

A simple python-cli tool to help drive the OKE-Operator-Container.

WIP:
- Intended to work by commands like `oke-connect uk-london-1` or `oke-connect uk-london-1-dev`. Where we feed in a config file (json) with tthe mappings from `uk-london-1` and `uk-london-1-dev` to different OKE Cluster OCID and region mappings
